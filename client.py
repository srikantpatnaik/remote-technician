# file: client.py
# desc: will scan the client machine for dependencies like motion server, python modules etc.
#       Should send binary/hex file to Arduino device(or any target) as soon as it receives the 
#       file from server. The file will be received and overwritten each time when technician
#       executes the program on HTML form. So need to monitor constantly for any updation in file.
